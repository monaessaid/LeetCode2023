// Initial thoughts:
// Step 1: Separate the strings into words based on the spaces
// Step 2: Use String.equals() to see if the strings are the same, if so, return the character count
// * Not sure how practical step 2 is since strs.length can be up to 200g
// Step 3: Iterate through each and compare character by character 
// Step 4: Print the characters from the 2 strings that are equal
// Step 5: Else condition should be "" for no common prefix
